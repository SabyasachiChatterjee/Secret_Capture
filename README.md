# Secret_Capture
Today I have done a Python Project On Secret_Capture...

Secret_Capture is a screen recorder software. It can record your screen as well as your webcam. To start the screen capture you have to run the code and after that, if you want to stop your recording then press 'q' from your keyboard. you can find your output video on here- C:\Users\conta\PycharmProjects\secret_capture

Now coming to the prerequisites:

Install Python & PyCharm or any IDE into your machine then in terminal write 

pip install Pillow

pip install opencv-python

pip install numpy

pip install opencv-python

Now you can see my code on my GitHub Repository.
